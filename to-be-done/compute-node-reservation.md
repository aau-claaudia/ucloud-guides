# Reserving Compute Nodes for Lectures
To facilitate hands-on learning and ensure your students have access to the necessary computational resources during your lecture, AI-LAB provides a reservation system for compute nodes. As a lecturer, you can reserve a specific number of compute nodes for your class by filling out this [AI-LAB compute node reservation](https://forms.office.com/e/CAYUQbRwnZ) form. 

Your request will be reviewed and approved by CLAAUDIA and you will receive a confirmation email once your reservation has been approved. Ensure that you have received the confirmation before the lecture date. On the day of the lecture, the reserved compute nodes will be available to you and your students at the specified time.

You can get an overview of reserved days in the table below. You might need to log in with your AAU Microsoft account to see the table.
