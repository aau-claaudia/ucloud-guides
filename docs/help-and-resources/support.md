!!! info "A good practice for asking a question"
    To ensure optimal technical assistance, we advise you follow these recommended practices when submitting questions and requests:

    1. Use a detailed subject line. Doing so facilitates the quick identification of the problem and connects it with similar incidents previously reported by other users.
    2. Clarify what you have done so far and which operating system you use. Include specifics like which applications you are using. This detail aids in accurately recreating your environment to better understand the issue.
    3. Explain the issue and what you intended to achieve. Provide a comprehensive description of the issue, noting what has worked up to that point and the steps you've taken in an attempt to resolve it.
