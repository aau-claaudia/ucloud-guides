To further explore and enhance your use of AI-LAB, we recommend to take a look at the following guides:

- Before running a job, learn how to [**check the queue**](../additional-guides/checking-the-queue.md) to see how many jobs are ahead of you or review your own job status
- Discover how to run a container in [**interactive mode**](../additional-guides/running-a-container-in-interactive-mode.md) by using `shell` instead of `exec`
- Submit a job to Slurm with a [**bash script**](../additional-guides/run-a-bash-script.md), a text file containing commands you would typically enter in the terminal
- Learn how to [**monitor the resource status of compute nodes**](../additional-guides/checking-the-status-of-compute-nodes.md)
- Implement [**checkpointing**](../additional-guides/checkpointing.md) with Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to allow your jobs to resume from a saved state after interruptions
