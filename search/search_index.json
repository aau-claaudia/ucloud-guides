Clusters are used for tasks that require high performance and availability, such as scientific simulations, data analysis, and large-scale web services.</p>"},{"location":"help-and-resources/glossery/#compute-nodes","title":"Compute nodes","text":"<p>Compute Nodes are the individual computers within the Computing cluster that perform the actual computational work. Each compute node is a separate computer, equipped with its own processors (CPUs), memory (RAM), and GPUs for specialized computations. Compute nodes are networked together and run a unified operating system and software environment. Compute nodes are tasked with executing the computational jobs submitted by users. In AI-LAB, users don't interact directly with compute nodes. Instead, they submit jobs through the job scheduler Slurm, which then allocates the necessary resources and runs the job on the compute nodes.</p>"},{"location":"help-and-resources/glossery/#slurm","title":"Slurm","text":"<p>The Slurm queue system is AI-LABs job scheduling and management tool commonly used in HPC environments. It efficiently allocates computing resources by prioritizing and scheduling jobs submitted by users based on their requirements and available resources.

Line endings often get converted when files are moved between Linux and Windows. This conversion is a frequent issue as Linux and Unix-like systems use <code>\\n</code> for line breaks, whereas Windows uses <code>\\r\\n</code> (CRLF, Carriage Return + Line Feed). </p> <p>Solution: In code editors such as VS Code or PyCharm, you can switch between LF (Linux endings) and CRLF (Windows endings) from the right-hand side of the status bar at the bottom of the window.

Consequently, Slurm may encounter authentication issues, preventing you from running a job, and you may notice the job hanging when you run <code>sinfo</code>.</p> <p>Solution: Often, the problem resolves itself after some time (~20 minutes), and you will be able to run jobs again. You can also try running the <code>id</code> command to translate the username to UID, which usually gets cached and starts working after a while.</p>"},{"location":"help-and-resources/support/","title":"Support","text":"<p>The platform offers support through the CLAAUDIA team.
